# API Reference

In this section, we provide a detailed reference of the Asgardian API, including all available methods, their parameters, and usage examples.

## Overview

Asgardian provides a comprehensive set of methods to define, manage, and check permissions. Here, you will find detailed documentation for each method.

## Methods

### `createAbility`

Creates a new instance of the ability that can be used to define rules and check permissions.

#### Syntax

```ts
createAbility()
```

#### Returns

An instance of the `Ability` class.

#### Example

```ts
import { createAbility } from 'asgardian';

const ability = createAbility();
```

### `can`

Defines a rule allowing a specific action on a resource.

#### Syntax

```ts
ability.can(action: string, resource: string, condition?: (resource: any, context: any) => boolean)
```

#### Parameters

- `action` (string): The action to be allowed (e.g., `read`, `update`).
- `resource` (string): The resource on which the action can be performed (e.g., `Post`, `Comment`).
- `condition` (function, optional): A function that evaluates whether the rule applies given the resource and context.

#### Example

```ts
ability.can('read', 'Post');
ability.can('update', 'Post', (post, context) => post.authorId === context.userId);
```

### `cannot`

Defines a rule disallowing a specific action on a resource.

#### Syntax

```ts
ability.cannot(action: string, resource: string, condition?: (resource: any, context: any) => boolean)
```

#### Parameters

- `action` (string): The action to be disallowed (e.g., `delete`, `manage`).
- `resource` (string): The resource on which the action cannot be performed (e.g., `Post`, `Comment`).
- `condition` (function, optional): A function that evaluates whether the rule applies given the resource and context.

#### Example

```ts
ability.cannot('delete', 'Post');
ability.cannot('delete', 'Post', (post, context) => post.authorId !== context.userId);
```

### `isAllowed`

Checks if a specific action is allowed for a given resource and context.

#### Syntax

```ts
ability.isAllowed(action: string, resource: string, resourceInstance: any, context: any)
```

#### Parameters

- `action` (string): The action to check (e.g., `read`, `update`).
- `resource` (string): The resource for which the action is being checked (e.g., `Post`, `Comment`).
- `resourceInstance` (any, optional): An instance of the resource, if applicable.
- `context` (object): The context in which the action is being checked, typically including the user.

#### Example

```ts
const user = { id: 123, roles: ['admin'] };
console.log(ability.isAllowed('manage', 'all', null, { user })); // true
```
