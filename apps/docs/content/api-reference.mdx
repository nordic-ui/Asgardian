# API Reference

In this section, we provide a detailed reference of the Asgardian API, including all available methods, their parameters, and usage examples.

## Overview

Asgardian provides a comprehensive set of methods to define, manage, and check permissions. Here, you will find detailed documentation for each method.

## Methods

### `createAbility`

Creates a new instance of the ability that can be used to define rules and check permissions.

#### Syntax

```ts
createAbility()
```

#### Returns

An instance of the `Ability` class.

#### Example

```ts
import { createAbility } from '@nordic-ui/asgardian';

const ability = createAbility();
```

### `can`

Defines a rule allowing a specific action on a resource.

#### Syntax

```ts
ability.can(action: string, resource: string, conditions?: Record<PropertyKey, unknown> => boolean)
```

#### Parameters

- `action` (string | string[]): The action to be allowed (e.g., `read`, `update`).
- `resource` (string): The resource on which the action can be performed (e.g., `Post`, `Comment`).
- `conditions` (object, optional): An object which can be used to further restrict the rule's evaluation.

#### Example

```ts
ability.can('read', 'Post');
ability.can(['update', 'delete'], 'Post', { authorId: user.id });
```

### `cannot`

Defines a rule disallowing a specific action on a resource.

#### Syntax

```ts
ability.cannot(action: string, resource: string, conditions?: Record<PropertyKey, unknown> => boolean)
```

#### Parameters

- `action` (string | string[]): The action to be disallowed (e.g., `delete`, `manage`).
- `resource` (string): The resource on which the action cannot be performed (e.g., `Post`, `Comment`).
- `conditions` (object, optional): An object which can be used to further restrict the rule's evaluation.

#### Example

```ts
ability.cannot('delete', 'Post');
```

### `isAllowed`

Checks if a specific action is allowed for a given resource and context.

#### Syntax

```ts
ability.isAllowed(action: string, resource: string)
```

#### Parameters

- `action` (string | string[]): The action to check (e.g., `read`, `update`).
- `resource` (string): The resource for which the action is being checked (e.g., `Post`, `Comment`).
- `conditions` (object, optional): An object which can be used to further restrict the rule's evaluation.

#### Example

```ts
const user = { id: 123, roles: ['admin'] };
ability.isAllowed('manage', 'all'); // true
```

### `notAllowed`

Checks if a specific action is not allowed for a given resource and context.

#### Syntax

```ts
ability.notAllowed(action: string, resource: string)
```

#### Parameters

- `action` (string | string[]): The action to check (e.g., `read`, `update`).
- `resource` (string): The resource for which the action is being checked (e.g., `Post`, `Comment`).
